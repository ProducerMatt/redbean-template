# Template for Redbean Projects

This repo contains two options for managing your project: a shell script, and a
Makefile.

To make your redbean launch a browser on start, uncomment
`LaunchBrowserOnStart()` in `srv/.init.lua`.

M1 Mac users should use the default `MODE` instead of `asan-`, this can be set
in the top of your Makefile/build.sh

### build.sh

- `build.sh init`: download Redbean, zip, and sqlite
- `build.sh pack`: put contents of `srv/` into a fresh redbean, overwriting
  previously existing bean.
- `build.sh run`: pack and then execute custom command found at top of file

Stock redbeans are hidden with dots. Executables are excluded in the
`.gitignore`. Since they are *Actually Portable*, you *could* disable this
behavior and commit the executables directly, if you're ok with keeping them in
the git store. Also remember that binaries have a certain risk profile of their
own.

### Makefile

You can also use `make` to do the above.

- `make` will do `make download` + `make add`
- `make download` will download all of the requirements.
- `make add` zips the contents of `/srv` into your `redbean.com`.
- `make start` or `make start-daemon` will start the webserver (in foreground and background, respectively)

See also: `make stop-daemon`, `make restart-daemon`, `make log`, `make ls`

### Roadmap

- Build.sh
  - **INIT**: `build.sh init [-s for sqlite?]`
    - [x] Fetch Redbean, save as read-only stock build.
    - [x] Also fetch zip & sqlite
    - [ ] make sqlite opt-in
    - [ ] *Verify checksums for known versions/generate checksums for new
          ones*
  - **PACK** (default with no arguments)
    - [x] force copy stock redbean to writable file. Zip contents of `srv/`
          into zip
    - [ ] user-specified actions: if one script named `packer*` exists and is
          executable, run it
    - [ ] *if sqlite.com and `default.sqlite` exist, force copy
          `default.sqlite` to `db.sqlite`*
  - **RUN**
    - [x] pack and then execute command specified in variable
